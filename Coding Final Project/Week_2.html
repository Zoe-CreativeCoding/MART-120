Week_2
<p>We had two different labs in this unit. We used Code.org to do a dance lab and a artist lab. The first of these labs was to make several characters on the screen dance. We were given several pre-make actions for the characters, which we could mix and match as we wanted.</p>
<p>The second of these labs teaches us how to use commands to create simple shapes. We mostly focused on squares and circles, but this method could be used to make all sorts of other strange shapes.</p>
