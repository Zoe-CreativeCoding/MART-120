Week_6
<p>In this section, we created rudimentary websites, with titles, paragraphs, and links to different pages on said website.</p>
/*
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is Where the Title of the page goes!</title>
    </head>
        <body>
            <h1>This is where headers for different paragraphs go.</h1>
            <p>These are paragraphs, where most of the writing on the webpage is located.</p>
        </body>
</html> 
/*
<p>The example I have written above is how a basic webpage is set up. I like to think of it as a basic essay format, this headers, titles, and the main body, or paragraphs.
    But that isn't the only thing we can do on a webpage. We can also create lists or add images.
</p>
/*
<Html>
    <title>This is how you insert a image</title>
    <body>
        <img src="picture.jpg" />
    </body>
    <title>There are two types of lists. Organized and Unorganized.</title>
    <body>
        <ol>
            <li>This List is Organized</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>This List is Unorganized</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </body>
</Html>
/*
<p>Once we have the first page set up, we need to be able to link to the other pages of our website.</p>
/*
<a href="otherpage,html">This is a Hyper Link</a>
/*
<a href="Final Project Website">Return to Homepage</a>
