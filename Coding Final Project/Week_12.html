Week_12
<p>This week was a deeper look at functions. We have been using functions since the beginning of class, although we didn't always know it.
Scratch, Alice, and the other coding websites we used had pre-made functions, so that we didn't need to type out the entire thing.
They act as a way to make maintaining our finished easier.
