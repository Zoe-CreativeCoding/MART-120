Week_4
<P>For this unit, we returned to Code.org. But instead of making characters dance or drawing shapes, we were instead creating rudimentary games.</P>
<p>We used some of the same ideas that we had in the Scratch project in order to make our games. We took the characters, dialouge, and background to make a world, then added interactivity to make a game. The player is able to move at least one character and can gain or lose points based on different factors.</p>
