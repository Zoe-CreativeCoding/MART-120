Week_9
<p>This week we were introduced to a website called p5.js. This website uses JavaScript in order to create drawings, animations, and rudamentary games.
    For this week, we learned to create shapes.
</p>
/*
function setup ()
  {  
createCanvas(300,500);
  }
function draw()
{
    background(450);
}
/*
<p>This is the basic set up for a drawing using JavaScript. We have two functions, one to create the canvas we are working on 
    and another function for the actual shapes of a drawing.</p>
