Week_10
<p>This week, we added onto the portraits that we created in p5.js. Now that we have shapes, we are now going to make them move.</p>
/*
var object = 67;
function Setup
{
    createCanvas (400,500);
}
function draw()
{
    background(230)
    object++;
    console.log(object);
}
/*
<p>This is the intial variable set up. Once we have this established, we will use it for all of the variables in our shapes. 
By doing so, we can make the shape move around the canvas in incriments of one. If we want the object to move forever, we simple add {movement*-=;}.</p>
