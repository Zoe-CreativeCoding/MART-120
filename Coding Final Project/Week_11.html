Week_11
<p>For week 11, we looked into, loops, structures, and variables that are based on events. To start with, we used the same basic setup as the previous week.</p>
//
var x
var y
var diameter
function setup ()
{
    createCanvas (var 1, var 2)
}
function draw()
{
    circle(x,y,diameter);
}//
<p>Once we have the basic set up complete, then we add something new to create movement. After the circle is created, we add x+=#; in order to make the circle move back and forth.</p>
<p>Now that we are done with the movement loop, we move on to something called control structures. By adding control.log, we are able to create an if statement, which is the set up for our conditional events. 
Adding onto our if statement is our else statement. That way, we have a reaction whether our variable fits into the parameters or not.
