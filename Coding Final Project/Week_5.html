Week_5
<p>Alice works like a more advanced version of Scratch. It has several premade backgrounds and objects that you can use for your project. The program lets you do all sorts of things to the object, including changing there angle, size, and color.</p>
<p>Similar to Scratch, Alice has pre-set functions that allow you to make the characters do actions. If we wanted to make a animation, we would just use these functions. However, making a game forces us to use conditional functions. If/Then statements being the most common ones.</p>
